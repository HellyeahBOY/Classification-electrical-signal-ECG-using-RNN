Heart Disease Detection through ECG Signal Reconstruction
Description
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection and diagnosis can help reduce mortality and improve treatment outcomes. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide valuable information about the electrical activity of the heart. However, these signals can be corrupted by noise and artifacts, making it difficult to accurately interpret them. This project aims to reconstruct ECG signals, improving their quality and enabling more accurate diagnoses.

Duties
Data Collection: Collect ECG electrocardiogram data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. Apply a Lowpass-Filter method to filter noise in the dataset.
Parameter Determination: Observe the heart rate cycle to determine the data learning parameters of the LSTM model.
Model Building: Build LSTM model architecture, select optimization algorithms, and loss functions to reconstruct ECG signals. Evaluate the model through a validation set and test set to fine-tune the parameters.
